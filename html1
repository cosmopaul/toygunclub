    As I walked home from work one night at around 11pm I did my usual routine; I walked by a park near my house and smoked weed out of an apple. I usually only sit there somewhere between 5 or 10 minutes. As I carved my apple pipe and shoved my gluey weed in it, a soft-spoken man approached me. He was wandering around this park mumbling away to himself. He told me he wished he had a beer. His voice was pure, it was fragile. You could feel it; it was plush. He sounded like a teddy bear. I said i wish i had a beer too, he started to try and give me some sort of pseudo-advice banter. He was not very coherent. He then repeatedly asked for my name I said I didn’t want to give out my name he asked again and again and I said I was just hungry. He said he was going to call me “Happy Birthday”. That was my name, “Happy Birthday”. He told Happy Birthday to follow his dreams to get lost in the stars and forget what being confined to this earth and body is; he told him to have no regrets he told him to love his life and the people around him. He told these things to Happy Birthday. If only I was there to listen. I smoked weed and walked home anxiously looking behind my shoulder over and over again until I walked through my front door.

    A cute 17 year old girl got a summer job helping a disabled man. Wash him, feed him and take him out. He is about 30 years old and is incapable of moving or speaking at all. He is just living and breathing. He falls in love with her but is unable to voice how he feels. She does not care about him whatsoever, she only needs some money over the summer to buy Fireball whiskey and cigarettes. She goes to beach parties and hooks up with jocks, the man resents that. She is his sweet angel caretaker. She picks him up the next day, hungover, only semi-aware of what’s going on; she’s thinking about the next fire her and her friends are going this summer. What could the disabled man possibly do? He knew there was no way he could ever end up with her. The only thing he knows he could do is kill himself to get her to feel at least some way about him, but he can’t even do that. The summer ends and his mother is home from her vacation in the Bahamas with her third husband. “What a cute young woman that was” his mother says on her day back in town. He breathes deep as the girl goes on her way. He lays awake thinking about how she could never care.

<body>Alex is a scrawny, long-haired 18 year old who lives with his jaded old father. His Father is bitter, rarely speaks and is single. He spends most of his time chain-smoking outside their low-income housing unit. Alex has very poor social skills but it’s beyond that, he has autism. His father doesn’t know nor care, however he does know something isn’t right with him; but never bothered to check it out. Alex doesn’t know why he wants to resent his father, he actually feels guilty of it. He wants to rebel, but he can’t. Early in the morning Alex runs to the gravel parking lot of the Church near his house to dance. He doesn’t care who sees, he goes in his stained track-pants and extra-small shirt that looks baggy because of how skinny he is. Alex doesn’t make eye-contact with anyone. He is going to live under a shell for his whole life, with no understanding of social interaction. That is until his father dies, which deep down he hopes will be sooner than later.</body>
